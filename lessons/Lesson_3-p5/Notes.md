# [p5.js - An add-on for Javascript](https://p5js.org/)

## What is p5.js

p5.js is an add-on for Javascript that makes doing lots of graphics work (and other tasks) much easier to approach.  You can animate and interact with objects much, MUCH easier.  You can still use whatever Javascript (or other Javascript add-ons) you want in addition to p5.

## Using p5.js

You can use p5.js by either loading it into a normal Javascript file, or how we will use it normally, in the [p5 Web Editor](editor.p5js.org)
