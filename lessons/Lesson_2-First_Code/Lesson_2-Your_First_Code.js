/*

Let's build something!

Reminders:

- If you need to store a value, use a variable.  It can be a:
	- number,
	- string,
	- boolean,
	- array (a.k.a. an ordered list),
	- object (a.k.a. an unordered list of named values),
	- function (chunks of reuseable code that you pass inputs to and it gives back outputs)

Your task:

1. Build a program with a function that takes in a name (as a string), then display "Hello, 'NAME', nice to meet you!" back using console.log()
2. Add an if statement to you function that checks if the name that was entered is the same as your name. If it is, then instead display "Wow! That's my name too!"
3. Now make a loop that goes through an array of names, and runs the function for each name.
